***PLEASE USE THE CP BRANCH FOR EVERYTHING***

Project Overview:
Our project is a 2D game similar to Mega Man where there is a stage with moving objects and roaming enemies that you can either avoid or kill.
The player is a circular object that is able to jump, shoot, and move horizontally.
Upon reaching the end of the stage, there is a final boss with a beautiful picture of our favorite professor.

Build Overview:
To build our project we used Unity to create the necessary objects for the game.
The objects we created include the circle for the player, minor enemies, final boss, components of the stage, amd bullets.
Each object then has specific functions like how each is supposed to move and act. 
The player has specifc functions like shooting, jumping, and moving horizontally.
Each enemy is also able to move horizontally and shoot.
Both the player and enemies have also health bars that decrease when hit by a bullet.
This was created by using a slider and a function that checks whether a bullet is in the same spot as the player or enemy.
If the bullet overlaps with the player, the slider will decrease.
Since there's components of the stage that are able to move, they must also have their own functions for this.
The background is just a constant image with a camera that is locked onto it.
Also, the final boss has similar characteristics to smaller enemies, but it is able to take more hits and has more attack capabilities. 


Back Story:
The main character of the game is James Wasson, who struggles tremendously through all the hardships the class has to offer. This includes multiple all-nighters, hundreds of red bulls, and years worth of therapy because of PTSD.
Will he beat the final boss and finish the class with at most a C, or will he die and change his major? Play the game, and decide his fate... His future is in your hands.
