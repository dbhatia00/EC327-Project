***PLEASE USE THE CP BRANCH***

Project Overview:
Our project is a 2D game similar to Mega Man where there is a stage with moving objects and roaming enemies that you can either avoid or kill. The player is a circular object that is able to jump, shoot, and move horizontally. Upon reaching the end of the stage, there is a final boss with a picture of our favorite professor.

Build Overview:
In order to build our project, please clone the repo and navigate to the CP branch (it should be the default branch). Navigate to the Program folder, find the executable file, and run the program. 

=====Game Control=====
  <- & -> : moving left and right
  up arrow : jump
  space : shot
  "R" : restart the game (in case the play is killed or drop out of the stage)

Source Code Location:
Please navigate to the Assets folder in the SourceCode folder. The code that we wrote is contained within the C# files in said folder. 

Back Story:
The main character of the game is James Wasson, who struggles tremendously through all the hardships the class has to offer. This includes multiple all-nighters, hundreds of red bulls, and year's worth of therapy because of PTSD.
Will he beat the final boss and finish the class with at most a C, or will he die and change his major? Play the game, and decide his fate... His future is in your hands.
